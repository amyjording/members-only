## Part of The Odin Project

* [Odin Project Authorization](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication) - "In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it."
